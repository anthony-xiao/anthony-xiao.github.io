        <h1>Time and habit</h1>

        <p class="question-header">which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</p>
        <p>The techniques I attempted were:</p>
            <ul class="li">Pomodoro Technique</ul>
            <ul class="li">Flow and how to get into a flow</ul>
            <ul class="li">Seven conterintuitive ways to be insanely productive</ul>

        <p class="question-header">what did you find interesting?</p>
        <p>There were a few things I found interesting, especially the ones I attempted (reason for trying them were because they were interesting). The first thing is from the "Seven Counterintuitive Ways" one of the point mentioned giving yourself less time. It is not always true that more time the better. This made me think about myself and that often I do my best work when under the right amount of pressure and as if I won't have enough time.</p>
        <p>Anohter point I found interesting is the idea of getting into "Flow" from working and playing sports it was something you knew you can get into, but never thought about consciously trying to get into the groove. Trying this was very interesting and it wasn't easy to get right.</p>

        <p class="question-header">what worked for you?</p>
        <p>The ponmodoro technique definitely helps. This was something that I have seen my collegues do, and have always been interested in trying. After trying it definitely does help keep you more focused and having that short term goal keeps you pushing through.</p>

        <p class="question-header">which will you experiment further with?</p>
        <p>I would love to continue to work on the other 2 outside of pomodor that I have started. A big goal of mine is to become more efficient and productive. I feel like if these to I can fully grasp and control it I will eb able to take one step closer to my goal.</p>
