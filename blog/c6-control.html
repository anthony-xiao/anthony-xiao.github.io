                <p>
                    During programming one trigger that can get an emotional reaction from me will be finding myself missing the obvious. If I am stuck and having to find help whether online or from someone else, when I see the answer and it is quite obvious and something I know, it makes me think why did I not think of that. Otherwise in general I am pretty calm and most situations and try to take on challenges even keeled.

                <p>
                    After trying the Siberian North Railroad it felt interesting. I can understand what the exercise is trying to do but I think because of already having done something similar and know what it is trying to achieve made it less effective than it would have. I really do like the exercise and what it tries to do. Maybe also to do with my personality it felt a bit too long. Next time I will try a shorten version see if it will suit me better and get the results. I think this is something very beneficial because I have seen many who have been effected by their emotion and as a result hurt their work and performance.
