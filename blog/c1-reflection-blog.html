                <p>
                    My take after watching the video and the interactions I have had with the team is that this will be an experience filled, interactive, and valuable experience. It is an experience where it is about the process. Learning the process and mindset of coding, learning the proceess of collarborating with others, understanding what is is like to code and be in the development world. Also it will be a place where what you put in is what you get out. It is not 'school' where you earn and receive any sort of 'certificate' your 'certificate' will be the knowledge you learn.

                <p>
                    My impressions are EDA is a place for those who are really interested in being a developer and understand coding. It is not your traditional school, it is a place where you can set yourself up for success. It feels like EDA is more than just learning about the languages, it is about understanding them and fully know how to use them.

                <p>
                    I think I will enjoy working in this type of culture. From the video it mentioned taking control and being hungry. This is something I am always willing to do and will take on the advice on doing so during the course. Try to soak in all that I can.

                <p>
                    Also having a creater mindset will be very interesting. Making sure that we think outside the box and don't just do the ordinary. Makes sure we are constantly thinking of new ways to do things.

                <p>
                    I am very excited for this type of learning environment. There is a little nerves on how it will look once I am actually there and starting. But otherwise all excitement and making sure I set myself up ready to go when the courses start.
