    <h1>C1 Reflection</h1>

    <p> What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?<br>
    My take after watching the video and the interactions I have had with the team is that this will be an experience filled, interactive, and valuable experience. It is an experience where it is about the process. Learning the process and mindset of coding, learning the proceess of collarborating with others, understanding what is is like to code and be in the development world. Also it will be a place where what you put in is what you get out. It is not 'school' where you earn and receive any sort of 'certificate' your 'certificate' will be the knowledge you learn.
