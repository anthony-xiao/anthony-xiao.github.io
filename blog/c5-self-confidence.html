                <p>
                    From the reading, the definition of each where given. By reading it as well as the opinions given these two are very similar and can be the same thing. Both are talking about making sure your mind is aware and have the ability to be present.

                <p>
                    The technique I tried was the body scan. It was quite an interesting expereince for me personally because sitting still for a long period of time and not do anything is quite new. From feeling each part of the body it made me realise where I was tight, actually reminded me of my sitting posture. Also the emotions where interesting because it almost felt you were controlling the way you are feeling. One thing that was hard was having to keep bringing myself back to just focus on me and not have the brain wander off.

                    <p>
                        I quite agree with what is being discussed in this section. I think once you are able to become aware and able to adapt our emotions you are not your emotions because you are controlling it before it becomes you. Although I do believe with personalities you can be more susceptible to certain emotions than others but non that are uncontrollable. I do like to think when I feel a certain emotion I take a moment to think about it before really expressing it.
