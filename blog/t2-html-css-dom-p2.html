                <p>
                    Grid base design is the method of looking at we desing by thinking of it as rows and columns. This mehtod uses a human's natural reading habits, from left to right, top to bottom. By breaking the page into grids, it allows the developer an easier way to sort and organise the content. A grid base design is usually looked at as if a page is divided into 12 equal sections, allowing the freedom to have any combination numically to divide on the page.

                <p>
                    As time have passed there are more and more kinds of devices we use for our everyday web browsing. Anything from as big ask a desktop to a phone or tablet. With so many different screen sizes and ratios it is super important that a webpage can adjust to all of these. This is where responsive webpages come in. Allowing a front end developer to design the site once and working across all devices and screen sizes.

                <p>
                    Semantic structure is a way for us to label, and strucutre different content within HTML. The reason we need this is to make sure that more than what we see on the finished webpage, in the codes sections and contents are clearly labled what they are, and 'importance' of the content to the structure. Also these labels allow the ability to make CSS adjustments easier.

                <p>
                    From understanding the grid based design as well as the bootstrap tutorial it has made things a lot clearer on how to position a site. I went in before this lesson trying ot structure my own site but with this new knowledge it has made things easier to think about, and I will even redo the structure using the grid based design to make sure my site is setup for future success and adjustments.
