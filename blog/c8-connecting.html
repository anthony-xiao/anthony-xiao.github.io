                <p>
                    This was the first time trying any of the insight and techniques for growing trus and sincerity. Although some of the points discussed and mentioned has been come across, but not as consciuously or used as a technique. For example the three assumptions I try to think everyone are in the good, until proven otherwise. The book however breaks this down into more detail and allowed me to understand more why this is something that is good, and what we normally can think unconsciously.

                <p>
                    At the start of this it was a bit awkward for both parties. I personally am not the one to discuss emotions much, so for me to do this and for someone who knows me doing this with me they know it was out of the norm as well. As it went it did open up more and it was interesting listening to how someone feel in different situations, how that can be very differen to how I would feel about it. Also just learning about how much emotions can be expereinced during a situation when you really think about it and analyise it. From nervous to motivated to angry and then happy and this all within one situation.

                <p>
                    This meditation technique was quite interesting. It was the first time that it was done thinking about someone else instead of yourself. It did make it feel as if you were being kind as the book suggested. Although it was a bit weird doing this to someone so I did have to tell the person what I did. I think also if you tell the person this did happened and what were some of the quotes it will make them feel happy as well.

                    <strong>My Point of View</strong> <br>
                    The situation was regarding at work me having to fire one of my team members. It was a sitaution where the person was not performing up to the standards that were required. There was change that happened recently but everyone else seemed to have adjusted fine and their results were still at a high standard. This person was also being emotional and is running into conflict with a few others. As a result of this it was only right I took this action for the good of the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Other Point of View</strong> <br>
                    The situation was unfair. There had been change and being here for so long it will take time to adjust. During this adjustment period it should be understandable that some ups and downs would result from it. Also having been here for so long there should be some benefit of the doubt in regrads to work quality and trust that things will eventually come back around. With new leadership there should also be an understanding that not everyone will follow and we should be allow to express that, and doing so shouldn't be condemned. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exercise was quite nice to do in that in normal cases not many are 100% one way or the other. But doing this allows you to see why certain viewpoints come about and why what you personally see can also have a counter argument that is very valid.
