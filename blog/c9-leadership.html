                <p>
                    At my first job my boss and manager showed compassionate leadership and it was a factor in motivating me and me wanting to believe and follow their work. The leader was always about the team, he had high ambitions as well as expectations, but this was always done with understanding towrads each team member. Making sure what felt was always heard, and our opinions passed onto those who are making the decisions. Even if the decision was not what our opinions expressed, we knew that our voice was heard and thought about before the decision was made. This made it easier for the team to go from disagreeing to being part of this new plan and moving along with it.

                </header>
                <p>
                    I really like the progressive approach the meditation took in connecting goodness from within ourselves to the world. I am a big fan of breathing when it comes to the mind, whether it is calming down, refocus or in this case meditation. In the case of this exercise it really helped in keeping focus and knowing when to change the mindset. I thought it was quite important to really visualise the details. It made a more vivid impact post meditation when I review back on how it went.

                <p>
                    This meditation I found a bit harder to do compared to others, and maybe because of the difficulty it didn't felt as effective. Going from bad to good back to bad and to good. In my head I knew there is meant to be a switch of mindset, but in my head the previous thought would still pop in once in a while. What I did like was thinking about suffering of others, and being able to set my intention to try and alleviate their suffering.

                <header class="question-head"> How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</header>
                <p>
                    <strong>Status</strong> I think so far in phase 0 haven't shown up as much. For me it has still been mostly learning at home the idea of being triggered into a threat status has not hapeened. What has been applied is the idea of playing against yourself. Trying to beat my self and continue to improve. This I think has been important to do as well as going into bootcamp to keep doing. It keeps me going to improve on what I am learning. I want to have a mindset of do not try to compare yourself to others, be the best you you can be. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Certainty</strong> is definitely something that has shown itself during phase 0. Some times not knowing if I understood what was being asked. Also because everything is new that I am applying there is always a bit of second guessing when the knowledge is being applied. I think at bootcamp this will apply when we work on projects as a team. Trying to figure out the boundries we can go to as well as making sure that as a team we all know exactly what we are trying to achieve so that everyone is bought in and can have 100% energy spent on the project rather than thining about uncertanties. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Autonomy</strong>for me in phase 0 has been great. It is something I enjoy having more freedom of. The idea of trusting us to be able to learn what has been given and the freedom to learn it in our own way I think makes the learning more fun in phase 0. For bootcamp I would love to continue to have some freedom to be creative and working in a productive, high expectation, yet free way. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Relatedness</strong>is something that haven't shown up much during phase 0. For me it has been minimal interactions with others so it has been hard to really show and seen how relatable someone is. In bootcamp I think this will be important and be more of a common thing. I want to make sure I am someone seen as relatable or as the book suggests 'a frend'. Most importantly is to make sure all of us at bootcamp are there to learn and help each other learn. That way we can all benefit and come out as kick ass coders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fairness</strong>again haven't been something in phase 0 that has been faced. This will definitely be something I will pay attention to during the bootcamp and even in life in general. In projects we need to make sure to never underestimate a person's sense of fairness. Making sure that the work, the fun, the input are all fair to each member of the team.

                <p>
                    It happens so recently this was something that had happened during work. What was really helpful is having that third person point of view to start the conversation. Making sure that the topic is bought up at an, as much as possible, unbiased view. Also making sure to expore both parties stories was also really good in understanding why each person have their on view on this topic. Something that did not go as well as it could have was problem solve. It may have been me not being able to express and show more understanding of their point of view, the conflict of interest made it really hard to come up with a solution that will satisfy both sides.
