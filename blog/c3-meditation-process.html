                <p>
                    Reading and understanding 'Process over Product' helped me see the bigger picture when redesigning my site. After I completed the site, it looked almost identical to what it was. But I knew that it wasn't. I was able to overcome what I thought was a bit of a challenge in using skeleton. Also making sure that the CSS is far tidier than what it was in the first page. Even trying features that broke the page and getting frustrated as a result. This was actually a good experience, it made me have to put my thinking hat on and try different solutions, during this process I felt like I was learning (while losing my mind at times).

                <header class="question-head">What new things have you learnt about meditation?</header>
                <p>
                    Some of the new things I hae learnt about meditation is the following: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meta-attention </li>
                        <li>Breathing</li>
                        <li>Happy is the default state of mind</li>
                    </ul>
                    It was interseting reading meta-attention how that is a thing and something I have realise I have started to doing myself. Catching myself thinking or doing a behaviour I want to change. This lets me recalibrate and tell myself to do otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found breathing interseting because of how I play sports. This is something I often use to refocus and calm myself. If this is something that will also be useful to stay concentrated than it will be very beneficial for me personally having experience using this already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With so much clutter and throughts in everyone's mind it was very revealing that our mind's default state is actually happiness. It makes me want to get to that state more, remove all the 'extra' thoughts and be at a relaxed state. 
                </p>

                <header class="question-head">Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</header>
                <p>
                    Breathing will be one I will want to try having done it in sport I want to see how it will affect me when it comes to learning and work; Whether I will be able to translate the results over. Another one that stands out is understanding that the goal is mindfulness, if you need to react, react, and just be sure to continue maintaining mindfulness. Being able to do this while operating will be very beneficial while working.
