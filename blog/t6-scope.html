                <p>
                   A responsive site is a site that is able to adjust to the environment (screen resolution/size) of the user's device. Being able to change so that when going from one size to another the site is functioning as designed. The reason why responsiveness is important is because we have so many different devices and they all come in different sizes, this means that when a site is being built this needs to be considered. If not users who use devices that are smaller or larger than the intended design will have a bad experience or even no experience at all.

                <header class="question-head"> What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</header>
                <p>
                    Mobile first design is building a website by working thorugh it as a mobile form first. From there expand out to larger screens. The reason it is  important is because it is a smarter and more effective way to design sites. Rather than reducing a site as it goes to the smaller screens, it should be think of as if the screen is bigger lets make it more complex. This is knowing that smaller screen sizes usually mean a lesser system VS something bigger. If that is case we can make sure that at mobile the site is able to run smoothly and have all the functions that we want, and as we expand we know that the larger, and presumably better systems will be able to handle it.

                <p>
                    Framworks are a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem. It is a set of standardised code and rules that can be used so that developers or not redoing things from scratch and can reuse the codes provided.

                    Pros: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It speeds up the process having a foundation of codes already</li>
                        <li>Many will help with browser and device compatability</li>
                        <li>Helpful in collaborative work</li>

                    Cons: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can have unused code</li>
                        <li>Slow learning curve, adjusting to the rules and concenpts of each framework, while still adding in your own</li>
                        <li>Not actually learning how to write everything yourself if you are just starting to learn</li>
                        <li>Can limit customisation with some rules set in place</li>

                <p>
                    A wireframe is breaking down your desire site into very simple form to allow you so structure and organise your site as you building it. You look at the page and place boxes of where you want things to go. Prioritising what is important, making sure if you are using concepts, like the grid, you are able to visually see how much space you will have and ratiowise how much room each part of the page will take. We use it to make sure we have the key elements placed on our website, and a base to build from.

                <p>
                    The task required us to use skeleton as the framework for the site which took a while to get use to. Getting use to how the code works as well as making sure the designs I have translate over, both mobile and desktop.
