                <p>
                    The chapter on Emotional Intelligence was quite interesting to read for 2 reasons, I have an interest in how the psychology of humans work, and how applying this to engineers can benefit each individual and the team. Learning the benefits of EQ to an engineer was something good to be mindful of. Knowing that it can bring stellar work performance, outstanding leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness. All of which I would love to be able to have.

                    Reading how emotional intelligence can be learned was something new. It is something that is easy to understand but hard to do. For example using the body to deveop high resolution perceiption of emotion,in other words being conscious of our physiological reactions to gauge our emtions. Using this as well as other as a "break pedal" to give us more awareness of our emotions. From there training ourselves to improve our emotional intelligence.

                <p>
                    I tried both the breathing and doing nothing technique. I found the breathing one quite interesting in that it is really the first time that I have paid attention to my breathing for such an extended period of time. Normally I would try to adjust my breathing during sports to not get too emtional. Although not the same, the two minutes of breathing allowed me to feel I understand more, and have more control of my self mentally. For the doing nothing I found that a bit harder as because there was nothing to think about your mind will try to think and focus on something. It was a bit of a constant reminder to myself to nothing think too much.
