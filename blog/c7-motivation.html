                <p>
                    The three terms pleasure, passion and purpose all in Tony's words are types of happiness. <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pleasure</strong> - is about chasing the next high and also highly unsustainable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Passion</strong> - is the flow, and is where peak performance meets peak engagement, and it is more sustainable</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose</strong> - This is about being part of a bigger picture and is highly sustainable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    From reading Tony's concept it sounds like pleasure you are living the rockstar life style, getting that high, but very hard to sustain and it is usually a very short term thing. This is also the happiness that most of us look for the most when it should be purpose. Purpose allows you to see the bigger picture and more than just yourself.

                <p>
                    My core values first would be I believe everyone is different and everyone should be themselves but before that comes giving everyone an equal respect to start with. You never know how someone is when you meet them, everyone has a story behind them and until you know more about the person you should be respectful. I always say give everyone respect and it is their job to gain more or lose it. Another value would just be happy. Do what makes you feel happy. I love the saying 'you do you'. There are so many wonderful things around us that we should all go and find what we enjoy and enjoy it as much as you can.

                <header class="question-head">What do you stand for?</header>
                <p>
                    I would say I stand for respect and being the best that you can be. I think the world right now is so competitive and there are so much going on. This causes us to feel like we have to keep up with others, rather than just be the best we can be. Because at the end most of the times that means you have done exceptionally well and doesn't matter how others have done you will be happy with what you have accomplished.

                <p>
                    I really liked the resilience ideas. The idea of success and failure and being able to over come obstacles is something I enjoy and love to keep improving on about myself. I think in life it is easy to get complacent and like the quotes in the book suggested if you dislike failure than it probably isn't a good thing. An example would be learning about coding. As the book described it perfectly it is about feeling stupid. THis means you are porbably doing something new and innovative. Coming into the course with zero knowledge I feel like everyone else who are in this field are genius and I am just a baby compared to everyone. But this is also Motivation because there are more than a few people out there that are accomplishing awesome things within the tech industry and I want to work hard to get there as well. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the meditation exercise I think it is hugely helpful to be able to take on both success and failure and really think about it, and use that as a way to improve going forward. Also understand how you yourself react to these two emotions. Like previous chapters it alwasy helps to be mindfull about yourself.
