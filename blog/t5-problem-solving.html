                   The time I got stuck was when I was trying to come up with the solution to increase the counts for the different colors in the last exercise of 5.4. I started with pseudocoding to get an idea of how I want the code to read and whether that will maek sense. I aslo did console logging when I ran into errors and also to try out what the return will be for certan functions. Googling was also involved to get more clarity on different terms and what they can do. And the thing I would say I did the most is trying it out and keep trying.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Pseudocode - I feel reasonably comfortable, at times I do end up not making sense when there are too many steps, but I am improving and I feel like it is quite useful to do. </li>
                        <li>Trying Something - This is by far the best way I have found to learn, but there are still things I am not comfortable trying to still can improve here. </li>
                        <li>Rubber ducky method - I have tried this only a few times and will need to do more to be comfortable with it and understand when to use it</li>
                        <li>Reading error messages - This is something I feel reasonably comfortable with. I may not find the solution to the error all the time but I feel comfortable reading the message and locate the issue</li>
                        <li>Console.logging - something I have started doing more, I find it a great way to test small things written up in js to check what it returns.</li>
                        <li>Googling - defintiely something I have done A LOT. Feel reasonably comfortable with this one.</li>
                        <li>Asking for help from peers and coaches - this is something I haven't done yet in the EDA rooms, I have asked friends and that helped. Will try next time to ask the team.</li>
                        <li>Improving your process with reflection - something I need to imrpove on. Need to reflect and analyse myself better and utilise this to improve. </li>
