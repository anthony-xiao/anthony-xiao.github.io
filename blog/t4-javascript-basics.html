                <p>
                    Javascript, HTML, CSS all work together to make a webpage run as smoothly as it does. Each serving their part in making things work. HTML is the basic structure of the contents on a webpage, giving the page a foundation. CSS is used to give the webpage designs, in lamer terms 'make things look good'. Javascript is the function and the interactive element of a webpage. It is what goes behind the scenes that make a webpage interactive and fun.

                <p>
                    Control flow is when Javascript makes decisions base of the conditions of a code, it will excute one statement if the condition is true, and if it is false it will excute another. For exmaple when you wake up in the morning, if the statement 'it is the weekend' is true, than you play golf, if it is false you go to work. Following these statements can be continuing true or false statements and like a tree this will lead to many different scenarios.

                <p>
                    Loops is the ability for a code to be repeatedly run. There are two types, one is <strong>for loops</strong> one is <strong>while loops</strong>. For loops is that a code is run repeatedly for a known amount of times. For example I want to hit each of those 5 golf balls once. Where as while loops you do not know the amount of times it will run. For example keep on hitting golf balls until the sun is no longer up. You know a condition for this to end but the amount of times you repeat this action is unknown.

                <p>
                    Arrays in Javascript is when a variable is stored with multiple values of any data type. For example <code>var mySport = ["basketball", "golf", "football"]</code>. To access data in an array you find them through using index. The start of each array's index is always 0, meaning the to look for the first item you use 0 not 1. For example to search the mySport array for golf you would go <code>mySport[1]</code>. The 1 will bring the second piece of data within the array. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objects are a a collection of data using key and key-values. There are no particular order of the data and is searched by using the key. For example object: <br> 
                        <code>golf</code><br>
                            <code>brand: 'taylormade'</code> ,<br>
                            <code>type: 'driver'</code> <br>
                    To access data in an object you input the object name, then either a dot (.) or a bracked notaiton ([]) with the key you are looking for. e.g. <br>
                        <code>golf.brand;</code> or <code>golf[brand];</code>
                </p>

                    Function is a blog of code within Javascript that is designed to perform a certain task. It is there to help make life easier during coding and can be reused so that we do not have to write out the same code every time. There are many functions within Javascript that are and will be super helpful during coding.
