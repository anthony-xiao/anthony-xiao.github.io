                <p>
                    The first thing I found from the 'Mindfulness conversation' is how easy it is to lose track of what the speaker is saying, as well as how monologues this long are such a rarity now, whether it is we dont speak as much and or we are not able to hold attention for that length of time. Also in the practice I caught myself when I am the speaker to be mindful of how I am speaking but also at times how the listener is listening to me. Also like the book suggested being given the full attention to when speaking is a very rewarding feeling. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    My partner for this task also found it very different to a normal conversation. Not that it was as long, but for the length of time the speaker was speaking your mind is constantly remdinding itself to stay focused, you acutally become more awared of your own awareness. Another interesting point he bought up was that by not interrupting for the whole speak, you find some of the answers to would have been questions that interrupted the monologue being answered.

                <header class="question-head">Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</header>
                <p>
                    For me I would use the ‘Do less than you can’ and the ’Take one breath a day‘ techniques. I think both can help, also doing two helps me personally to be more aware of sustating these practices. The reason I chose the Do less than you can is it will be able to give a sense of achievement and also making sure that it is not a burden. Since you are doing less that what you are capable of this should make things easier as well as more enjoyable. The take on breath a day one is great I think beacuse it is long term and is a good way to continue to remind myself everyday on Mindfulness and lead to even other practices.
